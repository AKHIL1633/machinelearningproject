# Classifying Heart Diseases
This project leverages machine learning techniques to classify heart disease conditions using a dataset of medical parameters. The analysis and model development are carried out in a Jupyter Notebook, providing a comprehensive step-by-step approach.

## Model Architecture
The project employs a machine learning pipeline to classify heart disease conditions. Below is a detailed breakdown of the architecture and methodology
- Data Preprocessing
   - Handling Missing Values: Strategies like imputation or removal were used to handle missing data.
   - Feature Scaling: Normalization or standardization was applied to scale features to a uniform range.
   - Feature Selection: Relevant features were selected using statistical methods or domain knowledge.
 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Analyzed relationships between features using
      - Correlation matrices
      - Pair plots and histograms
      - Distribution plots for key variables
